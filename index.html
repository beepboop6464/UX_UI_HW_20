        <h1>About The Project</h1>
        <h3>The Goal</h3>
        <p>The overarching goal of this project was to elevate the Women’s Center website, prioritizing user
            satisfaction through the refinement of its navigation hierarchy. A key objective was to eradicate any
            potential confusion that users, particularly those experiencing emotional distress, might encounter. Our aim
            was to facilitate seamless access to essential resources, ensuring an optimal user experience</p>

    <!-- Phase 1 -->
    <div>
        <h1>Phase 1: User Research And Analysis</h1>
        <h3>Research Goals</h3>
        <p>When conducting our surveys and user interviews our primary goal was to understand the user's needs,
            particularly in challenging situations like being in an unsafe environments. we wanted our research to lay
            the groundwork for a redesign that's not only functional but also empathetic and supportive to users in
            distress, ensuring the interface provides the necessary resources and comfort during difficult times</p>
        <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
        <p>Our competitor analysis was instrumental in identifying opportunities to differentiate ourselves in the
            market. Through this analysis, we discovered that many existing options lacked a crucial aspect: discretion.
            This finding underscores the importance of integrating heightened privacy measures into our solution,
            ensuring that users feel secure and confident in their interactions</p>

    </div>
    <H3>Heuristic Evaluation</H3>
    <P>In our Heuristic Evaluation, we observed areas for improvement, particularly in the navigation system. The
        navigation bar appeared cluttered, lacking clear priorities or organization, which could potentially hinder
        usability, especially in high-pressure situations. Additionally, we noted instances where certain icons
        resembled links but were non-functional, suggesting a need for adjustments in the visual design to enhance
        clarity and user experience</P>
    <h3>Survey</h3>
    <p>We developed a comprehensive survey to gather invaluable insights from users, aimed at informing our website
        redesign process. Through thoughtfully crafted questions, we delved into users' expectations, preferences, and
        pain points. Two notable insights emerged: the optimal navigation structure and users' preferences for calming
        colors.</p>

        <img src="images\image 19.png" alt="" style="display: inline-block;">
    </div>
    <h3>Resarch Data Analysis </h3>
    <p>We analyzed the research data that we had gathered by using the affinity mapping technique, where we
        thoroughly discussed our individual findings and tried to group them into categories</p>

    </div>
    <!-- Phase 2 -->
    <div>
        <h1>Phase 2: Proto-Persona Insights</h1>
        <h3>Proto Persona</h3>
        <div class="persona-section">
            <div>

                <div>
                    <p>Uses the data we gathered to craft our proto-persona. We developed a profile of Emily, a
                        27-year-old married waitress who finds herself in an abusive relationship and seeks a safe way
                        out. This persona encapsulates the challenges faced by individuals in similar situations,
                        highlighting the need for supportive digital solutions. From there, we developed an empathy map
                        to better understand Emily's needs. Key insights include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users will need to enter and exit the site quickly without being at risk of exposure.</li>
                        <li>Users need quick access to resources; they have little time to navigate the site.</li>
                        <li>Developing effective communication channels between the user and support center.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="images/image 21.png" alt="">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: center"> <img src="images\image 22.png" alt=""> </div>
        <h3>Story Board</h3>
        <p>My team developed a storyboard illustrating how someone in a situation similar to our proto-persona, Emily,
            might interact with the site. Given the sensitive nature of the topic, it's crucial to consider the safety
            of users who may be accessing the website in the presence of their abuser. To address this concern, the
            original desktop site already included a quick escape button. However, in our redesign, we recognized the
            importance of extending this feature to the mobile version to ensure accessibility and safety across all
            platforms. I took charge of creating the artwork for the storyboard, ensuring that it effectively conveyed
            Emily's journey and the proposed enhancements to the digital solution.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center"><img src="images\image 23.png" alt=""></div>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>Building upon our understanding of the challenges faced by individuals seeking support from the Women’s
            Center website, we identified a critical issue which we made into our problem statement </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Women’s center website was designed to provide those involved in abusive situations with safe
                resources, support, and aftercare. We have observed that the website has no navigation hierarchy which
                could cause confusion when looking for fast resources on a time limit. How might we improve the center’s
                website so clients can quickly and discreetly access resources?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Value Proposition</h3>
        <p>In response to this problem, our team developed a value proposition centered</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We believe improving the women’s center website for those needing to escape or heal from an abusive
                relationship will achieve a safer, more discreet, and overall better experience to recreate a normal
                life.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Phase 3 -->
    <div>
        <h1>Phase 3: Ideation & Brainstorming</h1>
        <h3>Card Sorting and Sitemap</h3>
        <p>To begin, we structured our sitemap based on the survey data we gathered earlier. Our aim was to ensure that
            vital information is readily accessible to users. By organizing the site in this manner, we prioritize quick
            access to key resources and support services</p>
        <div class="sitemap-images">
            <img src="images\image 24.png" alt="">
            <img src="images\image 25.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <h3>User Task flow</h3>
        <p>We proceeded by developing a user task flow to gain deeper insights into how users would interact with the
            site. This helped us identify areas where certain features might need rearrangement or optimization to
            enhance the user experience</p>
        <div><img src="images\image 26.png" alt=""></div>
        <h3>Sketches </h3>
        <p>In the initial stages of our redesign process, our team began by sketching out ideas on paper prototypes.
            During this phase, one key decision was to ensure that contact information was prominently featured on the
            homepage and easily accessible from every page. Additionally, we determined that each page, including the
            homepage, would include a hero section with a striking image conveying empowerment and reassurance. These
            sketches laid the foundation for our website's design, allowing us to visualize and refine our ideas before
            moving into digital prototypes.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center"><img src="images\Group 391.png" alt=""></div>

    </div>
    <!-- Phase 4 -->
    <div>
        <h1>Phase 4: Wireframing & Prototyping </h1>
        <h3>low/mid-fidelity prototype</h3>
        <p>We then translated these insights into wireframes, ensuring our designs were not only user-friendly but also
            deeply empathetic to the needs of individuals. These wireframes formed the foundation for our initial
            low-fidelity prototype, reflecting our commitment to crafting a nurturing digital space for those seeking
            support and empowerment."</p>
        <div style="text-align: center"><img src="images\Group 392.png" alt=""></div>
        <h3>User Testing </h3>
        <p>To refine our designs for the women's centers interface, we conducted user testing with a focus on key
            functionalities. </p>
        <ul class="numbered-list">
            <li>Assess readability and effectiveness of the safety page.</li>
            <li>Enable easy access to live chat support.</li>
            <li>Locate and understand the function of the call feature </li>
            <li>Verify users' understanding of the exit feature for safety.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By prioritizing these goals we aimed to improve the user experience for individuals navigating sensitive
            situations</p>
        <h3>User Testing Key Findings</h3>
        <p>After conducting user testing, we implemented several minor adjustments to our prototype, such as optimizing
            the placement of elements and adjusting font sizes. However, the most significant insight gleaned from our
            testing was the confusion surrounding the exit button represented by an 'x.' Recognizing the potential
            severity of this issue, particularly in sensitive contexts such as domestic abuse, we opted to enhance
            clarity by replacing the 'x' with the word 'Escape.' This modification aims to ensure that users intuitively
            understand the function of the button, thereby improving the overall user experience</p>
        <div style="text-align: center"><img src="images\Group 393.png" alt=""></div>

    </div>
    <!-- Phase 5 -->
    <div>
        <h1>Phase 5: High Fidelity Prototype</h1>
        <h3>Style Guide</h3>
        <p>Next we began putting all our elements together into a style guide. It features carefully selected typography
            for clarity and professionalism. The color palette evokes feelings of safety. Icons and visual elements are
            intuitive and inclusive, aiding navigation and comprehension. accessibility features ensure a seamless
            experience across devices, supporting the center's mission of providing assistance to individuals.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center"><img src="images\Style Guide (1) 1.png" alt=""></div>
        <h3>Mobile High-Fidelity Screens</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center"><img src="images\Group 394.png" alt=""></div>
        <h3>Desktop High-Fidelity Screens</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center"><img src="images\Group 395.png" alt=""></div>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>After conducting thorough research and gathering insights through user interviews and surveys, we refined our
            navigation to prominently display essential information, ensuring clarity and ease of use for visitors to
            the women's center website. By incorporating multiple hover states within the navigation, we provide
            additional guidance and support to users as they navigate through the site, enhancing their overall
            experience.</p>
        <div class="navigation-container">
            <img src="images\2024-05-1903-20-09_1.gif" alt="">
            <img src="images\2024-05-1903-51-40_2.gif" alt="">
        </div>

        <h3>Escape feature </h3>
        <p>The "escape" feature is a button strategically placed within the interface of the websites, it provides users
            with a quick way to exit or hide the site's content to protect their privacy and safety</p>
        <div style="text-align: center"><img src="images\2024-05-1904-09-54_3.gif" alt=""></div>

    </div>
    <!-- Reflection -->
    <div>
        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>This project served as a valuable learning experience for me, particularly in handling the wireframing of the
            navigation. Through this process, I gained insights that I'll carry forward in future projects. It deepened
            my understanding of how subjects in the navigation should be displayed, prioritizing what's most important
            to users. Additionally, I acquired knowledge about implementing accessibility features, which I believe is
            crucial for creating inclusive designs. Moving forward, I'm eager to apply the insights gained from this
            experience to create more empathetic and accessible designs that truly meet the needs of users.</p>
